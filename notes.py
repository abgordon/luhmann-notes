implementation of "luhmann's second brain" or "luhmann's slip box"

"Early in his academic career, Luhmann realized that a note was only as valuable
as its context â€“ its network of associations, relationships, and connections to other information."

commands:
insert
edit
create-schema
delete

note attributes:
title
body
id
- ids increase sequentially forever
- id is a parent topic
- id has _no importance_ other than having the quality of being a top-level category and is the
  parent of a series of sub-ids. It is not an organizer of any kind.
- ideas are thematically unlimited and can be infinitely extended in any direction 
parents
- references other ideas
- a branch is a linked list of ideas that go off a parent topic
siblings
- the same implementation as parents, but semantically different

goals:
- a python script that can create notes
- runs on sql
- a web server that can be set up at any time and connect to a db of luhmann notes
  web server does some visualization with a graph of parent topics

TODO: going to try this with a docker db initally. Need a way to persist between iterations
    maybe I can just save a sql file and run a sql binary when I need to
