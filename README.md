# Luhmann notes


"Early in his academic career, Luhmann realized that a note was only as valuable as its context â€“ its network of associations, relationships, and connections to other information."

Inspired by [this article](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/how-to-take-smart-notes/)

Run a sql container and store extensible notes. TODO: This shouldn't run as a container because inevitably the container will go down and you will lose all of your work. I need to buy an amazon sql server...

### works in progress

- web server that provides an interface to the notes 
- AWS server that persists everything and I can access from any computer, anywhere
